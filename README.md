Why Riverpod?
I chose Flutter Riverpod as the state management solution:

ðŸ”’ Compile-time Safety: Riverpod catches provider errors at compile time, preventing runtime crashes
ðŸ§ª Testability: Providers can be easily overridden for testing without complex mocking
ðŸ“¦ No Context Dependency: Providers can be read anywhere without requiring BuildContext
ðŸ”„ Automatic Disposal: Providers are automatically disposed when no longer needed


Architecture Summary
UI Layer â†’ Consumer widgets watch providers
State Layer â†’ Riverpod providers manage state
Business Layer â†’ StateNotifiers handle business logic
Data Layer â†’ DatabaseService manages SQLite operations
